# Waste-Managemnt-System
ML-Based Waste Management System

I have worked on a Waste Management System, a one-stop solution for comprehensive waste management across India.

The primary objective of this system is to efficiently manage waste and generate revenue from it. Users can log in to our website and upload an image of their waste along with their location. Our advanced machine learning model then analyzes the type of waste without any human intervention. The request is stored in our database, and we schedule a truck appointment for waste collection, which is then stored in our warehouse. Once the segmented waste is sold through our website, we take a share of the profit and distribute a portion to the contributor.

We built the system using MongoDB, Node.js, TensorFlow, HTML, CSS, Scikit-Learn, and Python to train and deploy our machine learning model.

This was a team project of two members, where I served as the Project Lead. I developed the machine learning model by collecting datasets from Kaggle and other sources, combining multiple datasets to improve accuracy. Additionally, I designed the website's user interface.

The project was funded by SSIP Gujarat and IIIT Surat for development and deployment. While the development is complete, deployment is still in progress as we await the release of funds.

This project aims to provide an effective solution to waste management, addressing pollution in India. It enhances the quality of life for every citizen and aligns with the goals of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
